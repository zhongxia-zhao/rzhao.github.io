excerpt: 'Sequential games are a versatile model for many real-world interactive decisions, but they are also difficult to analyze because of their complex structure. One particular difficulty is in the representation of strategies in these games â€” this is typically defined as a complete plan of action for every possible situation the agent may encounter, but in practice this often differs significantly from how we actually think about many games. In this paper, I argue the standard normal form representation of sequential games includes many strategies that are too complex to be feasible for humans. I show then some theoretical results of how removing these ``complex" strategies leads to outcomes that better match experimental outcomes in the Ultimatum Game.'
