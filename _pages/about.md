I am a 6th year PhD candidate in the Philosophy Department at Carnegie Mellon University. My research interests are broadly in the areas of game and decision theory. In particular, my work focuses on modeling human behavior in complex dynamic games, where players are not ideally rational in the way that classical economic models prescribe.
